    <h1>Blueberry Cornmeal Galette</h1>
    <img src="../images/blueberry.jpg" alt="Blueberry Cornmeal Galette">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are foods that just work amazingly well with each other, and the combo of blueberry and cornmeal is a great example. That goes for both the flavor and texture, as the soft, sweet nuggets of blueberry are a perfect partner for the gritty goodness of the ground corn.</p>
    

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>For the Cornmeal Crust:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>½ cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons ice water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For the Blueberry Filling:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh blueberries, rinsed and dried</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons cornstarch</li>        
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For the Egg and Sugar Glaze:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon demerara sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine flour, cornmeal, and salt in a bowl with a pastry blender. Add cold butter and combine with the pastry blender until coarse crumbs form. Drizzle in cold water, a little at a time, stirring to combine with a fork, until dough comes together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn dough onto a work surface and bring together with your hands; press into a disk of dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat® baking mat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cornstarch in a bowl.

        </li>
        <li>
            Remove dough from the refrigerator and roll on a lightly floured work surface into a 15-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place blueberry filling into the center of the dough, leaving 3 to 4 inches of space around the border of dough. Fold dough up and around the berries, rotating a few inches and make another fold, overlapping the first; repeat around the dough until pleats are formed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine beaten egg and water in a small bowl and brush on the dough. Sprinkle on demerara sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the center of the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
